               <p>At EndFrame, we know you care about your privacy and how your personal information is used and shared. This Privacy Policy is designed to help you better understand how we treat your personal information.</p>
               <p>You should understand that by using or accessing our services in any manner, you are acknowledging that you understand and accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you are agreeing to how we may collect, use, and share your information as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>
               <p>You should also remember that your use of our Services is at all times subject to our <a href="terms.html">Terms of Service</a>, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any capitalized terms we use in this Privacy Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in our Terms of Service.<br/></p>

               <h2 class="legal-h2">What this Privacy Policy covers<br/></h2>
               <p>This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (‚ÄúPersonal Information‚Äù) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don‚Äôt own or control, or people that we don‚Äôt manage.</p>
               <p>We understand that users of our Services value their privacy, and one of our core values is to minimize our collection of Personal Information. There are instances where we do collect Personal Information, however, and this Privacy Policy explains those instances.</p>
               <p>As we‚Äôll describe further, we may gather different kinds of Personal Information from our users, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. This Privacy Policy will also cover how we may share some Personal Information with third parties in specific circumstances.</p>
               <p>If you are under the age of majority where you reside, you may use our Services only with the consent of or under the supervision of your parent or legal guardian. Consistent with the requirements of the Childrens Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), if we learn that we have received any Personal Information directly from a child under age 13 without first receiving their parents verified consent, we will use that Personal Information only to respond directly to that child (or their parent or legal guardian) to inform them that they cannot use our Services and we will delete that Personal Information.</p>
               <br/>
               <div class="legal-subsection">
                  <h3 class="legal-h3">Changes to this Privacy Policy<br/></h3>
                  <p>We are constantly trying to improve our Services and always want to adopt best practices with our privacy practices, so we may make changes to our Privacy Policy from time to time. When these are significant, we will alert you to changes and you will be required to agree to our new Privacy Policy in order to keep using your Services.</p>
                  <p>If you continue to use our Services after changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, you understand that you are agreeing to all of those changes. Use of Personal Information we collect is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such Personal Information is used.</p>

               <div class="legal-subsection">
                  <h3 class="legal-h3">Information EndFrame collects<br/></h3>
                  <p>We collect different kinds of Personal Information and describe each category below.</p>
                  <h4 class="legal-h4">Information You Provide to Us:</h4>
                  <p>We receive and store Personal Information you knowingly provide to us. It includes (i) contact information you elect to provide to us such as your email address, (ii) feedback and correspondence, such as information you provide when you report a problem with our Services or otherwise correspond with us, and (iii) marketing information, such as your preferences for receiving marketing communications like our newsletter and details about how you engage with them.</p>
                  <p>However, other than the information required to associate your GMail with our Services, you are not required to provide any other Personal Information to use the core features of our Services. But understand that you may be required to provide additional Personal Information to access certain features or offerings.</p>
                  <h4 class="legal-h4">Information Collected from Other Sources:</h4>
                  <p>We may obtain information from other sources, such as third- party applications you use our Services with. We may combine this with information previously collected when using our Services. In these cases, our Privacy Policy governs the handling of any combined Personal Information.</p>
                  <h4 class="legal-h4">Information Collected Automatically:</h4>
                  <p>Whenever you interact with certain parts of our Services such as our landing page or blog, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include your IP address, geolocation data, device identification, ‚Äúcookie‚Äù information, the type of browser and/or device you‚Äôre using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested.</p>
                  <p>We typically collect this information through a variety of tracking technologies, including cookies, embedded scripts, web beacons, file information and similar technology (collectively, ‚Äútracking technologies‚Äù). ‚ÄúCookies‚Äù are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Site are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device‚Äôs acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p>
                  <p>We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services - for example, this data can tell us what topics or features are most interesting to potential users of our Services, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services interesting to as many users as possible. For more about how we use Cookies and other tracking technologies, see our Cookies Policy.</p>
                  <h4 class="legal-h4">Do Not Track Policy:</h4>
                  <p>Your browser may offer you a ‚ÄúDo Not Track‚Äù option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Do Not Track signals are set on a browser-by-browser basis, so you must set them on every browser you use if you do not wish to be tracked.</p>
                  <p>We do not track our users over time and across third party websites to provide targeted advertising and therefore we do not respond to Do Not Track requests. However, some third party sites do keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you, and these third parties may not honor Do Not Track requests. Remember that this is just our Do Not Track policy, and we can‚Äôt and don‚Äôt make any promises about how third parties react when you set this signal on your browser, including any third party sites we may link to. You should always review the Privacy Policy and specifically, the Do Not Track policy, of a third party site to understand how they will respond to Do Not Track requests.</p>
                  <h4 class="legal-h4">Information we will never collect:</h4>
                  <p>We will never ask you to share your private keys to your Meetings or other security information that could be used to access your Meeting without your explicit consent and action.</p>

                  <h3 class="legal-h3">How EndFrame shares personal information<br/></h3>
                  <p>We do not sell Personal Information. Other than as described in this Privacy Policy, we do not share Personal Information that you provide us with other organizations without your express consent.</p>
                  <p>We may share your Personal Information with third parties in certain instances:<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ With your Consent: We may share Personal Information with your explicit consent.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ To our Affiliates: In certain situations, businesses or third-party websites we‚Äôre affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with our Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service.<br>
                    We have no control over the policies and practices of third-party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all of these business‚Äô or websites‚Äô policies.<br>

                  <p>We also secure Personal Information you provide in a controlled, secure environment and protect it from unauthorized access. We regularly audit our system and code for security vulnerabilities. We further protect the security of your information during transmission by using Transport Layer Security (TSL/SSL), which encrypts all information that you input.</p>
                  <p>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. The safety and security of your Personal Information also depends on you. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time. Your Account is protected by your password, and we urge you to take steps to keep this and other Personal Information safe by not disclosing your security credentials or leaving your Account unsecured.</p>
                  <p>Regardless, measures we take or that you take will not guarantee that your Personal Information will not be accessed, disclosed, altered or destroyed by breach of these security measures. By using our Services, you acknowledge that you understand and agree to assume these risks.</p>
                  <p>WE DO NOT AND WILL NEVER STORE YOUR ACCOUNT PASSWORD TO YOUR ACCOUNT. IF YOU LOSE ACCESS TO YOUR PASSWORD, WE WILL BE UNABLE TO HELP YOU ACCESS YOUR ACCOUNT.</p>
                  <p>Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to or choose not to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision. In some cases, we may also need to you to provide us with additional information, which may include Personal Data, if necessary, to verify your identity and the nature of your request.</p>
                  <h4 class="legal-h4">Your GDPR rights include:<br/></h4>
                  <p>‚Ä¢ Right to Access: You can request more information about the Personal Data we hold about you and request a copy of such Personal Data. You can also access certain of your Personal Data by visiting your user dashboard in some of our Services.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Right to Rectification: If you believe that any Personal Data we are holding about you is incorrect or incomplete, you can request that we correct or supplement such data. You can correct some of this information directly by editing them on your user dashboard in some of our Services.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Right to Erasure: You can request that we erase some or all your Personal Data from our systems. But, keep in mind that this will not erase any Personal Data you have submitted to the EndFrame network (or have requested we submit on your behalf), and you are acknowledging and agreeing that we are not responsible for deleting or assisting you in deleting information on the EndFrame network.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Right to Withdraw Consent: If we are processing your Personal Data based on your consent, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any time. Please note that if you exercise this right, you may have to then provide express consent on a case-by-case basis for the use or disclosure of certain of your Personal Data, if such use or disclosure is necessary to enable you to utilize some or all of our Services.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Right to Data Portability: You can ask for a copy of your Personal Data in a machine-readable format. You can also request that we transmit the data to another controller if technically feasible.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Right of Objection: You can contact us to let us know that you object to the further use or disclosure of your Personal Data for certain purposes.<br>
                    ‚Ä¢ Right to Restrict Processing: You can ask us to restrict further processing of your Personal Data.<br>

                <h3 class="legal-h3">Transfers of personal data<br/></h3>
                <p>Certain parts of our Services may be hosted and operated in part in the United States (‚ÄúU.S.‚Äù). If you do not reside in the U.S., your privacy laws may differ from the laws of the U.S. By using the Services and providing your Personal Data, you acknowledge that this Personal Data about you, regardless of whether provided by you or obtained from a third party, may be provided to us in the U.S. and may be hosted on U.S. servers. By accepting the terms of this Privacy Policy, you are agreeing to and authorizing us to transfer, store and process certain Personal Data to and in the U.S., and possibly other countries.</p>
                <p>We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your information is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. One such step we may take to ensure the security of your Personal Information in the event that a transfer may not be subject to the same protection in the EEA or Switzerland, is to enter into specific contractual clauses approved by the European Commission which ensure your personal information is given the same protection it has in Europe.</p>
